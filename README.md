    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:

## Code Explanation

*   **`index.html`:** This file contains the HTML structure of the calculator, including the display input field and the buttons.
*   **`style.css`:** This file contains the CSS styles for the calculator, providing the visual appearance.
*   **`script.js`:** This file contains the JavaScript logic for handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

    *   `appendToDisplay(value)`: Appends the given value to the display string and updates the display.
    *   `clearDisplay()`: Clears the display by resetting the display string.
    *   `backspace()`: Removes the last character from the display string.
    *   `calculate()`: Evaluates the expression in the display string using the `eval()` function and displays the result. It also includes error handling to catch invalid expressions.

The `eval()` function is used for calculation. While convenient, be aware of the security implications of using `eval()` with untrusted input. For more complex or production-critical applications, consider using a safer expression parsing library.
